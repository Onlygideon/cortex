A fun web game app
  
With my knowledge in human Anatomy as a Bsc degree holder and a self taught web developer it was fun building this project. It was built using just HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript
  
It slightly test the superior parietal lobe of the human brain that have been shown to be activated when placed in position of guessing a number and making a choice. 
 
It includes different game mode for the players.
